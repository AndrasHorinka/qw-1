History of [NF]Proxy/NITRO
--------------------------

Version 0.72:
-------------
news:
-i've splitted the proxy into two proxies one called [NF]Proxy and one NITRO! read above for more infos!
-i will release a third one which will be called NITROLITE it will just feature the message command %l and nothing else!
-the executeable is no longer packed (win32) because avp (antivirus) detects my packer as a virus ...
-added support for Ocrana Leds (visit www.ocrana.de - thanx to Slop) to the EasyFont!
 you can find the required gfx.wad in the proxy archiv - just copy it in your quake/qw directory ...
-David aka Pionir (http://www.pionir.demon.co.uk) mailed me very nice painskins for the intelliskin feature!
 you can find them in the archiv too!

removed bugs:
-removed many bugs so i only mention a few here ...
-fixed a bug in the location management that caused a problem in some maps like 2fort5r.bsp, the proxy reported
 the wrong position at the blue upper lift! thanx to [CiH]Vario for the bugreport!
-sometimes when using the gamespystarter it happens that the connect to the server went wrong because the qwcl
 needs to much time to execute the config files like NFProxy.cfg on startup. i've delayed the server connection
 on startup - now this should be no more a problem!
-changed the soundtrigger so that if the soundtrigger is enabled but blocked by fpd on the server it will filter
 the soundtrigger commands out of the messages.
-removed a bug that caused that you were not able to set a password or to change your speccing mode when not connected!
-intelliskin is no off by default ...
-f_version now reports a crc checksum with the current ip you are connected to added, ive removed the 
 NoTimers! message from f_version but its still in your userinfo!
-if you have set a locdir in the linux version the proxy could't find it ...

changed:
-if you set QWEXE/QWDIR and QWPARAMETERS in the NFProxy.ini the proxy launches qw automatically and connects to it!

new features:
-f_modified f_modified2 & f_modified3 added, read the "f_queries supported by [NF]Proxy" section for further info...
 you can enable/disable the f_modified check with .modified (its enabled by default!)
-added a new check for fpd filters called f_fpd! this one is a real hard one for all filter so go 
 and check it out at the "f_queries supported by [NF]Proxy" section!
-you can now use message groups, look at .filter!
-use .filterown to show/hide own messages send to groups you not belong to!
-the locfile directory can now be set using the new commandline parameter -l
-added the well known ocrana leds (colored characters used to see messages more easily!) to the easyfont
 use $R for red, $Y for yellow, $G for green and $b for blue! (copy the supplied gfx.wad into your quake/qw dir)
-a new halp page called .helpparameters shows u a description of all parameters need for the commands

Version 0.70:
-------------
removed bugs:
-removed a bug in the command parsing. if you tried to use [NF]Proxy commands in an alias the Proxy didn't took
 the last command!
-spectators don't autoreport anymore ... (a bug that in 0.66 appeared!)
-the armorvalue will is now resetted on mapchange ...!
-the gamemod config files (for example NFProxy_fortress.cfg) will now be called later!
 The problem was that [NF]Proxy commands used in this config files sometimes excecuted and sometimes not. 
 in this early phase of the server connecting procedure it can happen that the client does not send all 
 commands to the proxy ...
-changed the players death handling so the messagecommands %E %O %d and %L should now be more reliable!
-printptlong and listpowerupslong are now supporting the easyfont feature!
-if you are recording a game the qwcl clients aktivates the cl_nodelta feature so the server don't sends delta packed
 entities anymore, instead it sends for every game frame all data for every entity, this causes a lot of network traffic!
 the last versions of [NF]Proxy wasn't optimized for this mode so some people got lag effects when recording.
-the tooktrigger is now working correctly in cl_nodelta 1 mode (this mode is not recommended it causes much network traffic)
-you can now use spaces and tabs between proxy commands and their parameters!
-removed a bug in the autoreport (it reported even when the last teammate of you left the game ...)
-clanarena color handling fixed!
-fixed a bug in the server downloading code

changed features:
-the poweruptimers have been COMPLETELY REMOVED, read my comment on this above!
 because of the removement of the poweuptimers %g and %G will only reply with Powerup or the text set with .setnonename !!!
-rewritten all time critical parts of the code for speed enhancement and kicked many of my debug routines!
 so this is the fastest version of [NF]Proxy (this took me one week!)
-the fraglist will now automatically logged to a file called fraglist.log in the proxy directory!
-there are no longer limits for marks in loc files! only the location names are limited to 30 characters!
-autoreport now also calls f_team when the team member who took a powerup is not using [NF]Proxy!
-in teamfortress the deathtrigger will just be called if you have the enemyflag when dying!
-advanced the intelli reporting for team fortress!
-in teamplay 0 mode the proxy now tells you the name of the enemy who took a powerup!
-the help is now splitted into help pages!
-the easyfont now only check for color changes (#) in names  - not in messages,
 and the $ is only replaced if the following character is a valid easyfont command!
 -> so # and $ are now again available for soundtrigger!

new features:
-intelligent skin gives you the possibility to see what your teammates currently need just by looking at them.
 look at .intelliskin! this is a very powerfull feature so i have advanced the fpd settings!
-with .gospectate (.gs) and .goplay (.gp) you have the possibility to switch easy from specmode to playmode or vice versa
-added a filter for fov (.fovfilter) and for r_drawviewmodel (.weaponmodelfilter) which filters commands 
 coming from the server! the r_drawviewmodel is usefull if you want to play rocketarena in gl without your weapon on the screen
 the fovfilter is usefull for teamfortress and other mods changing your fov ...
-you can now configure [NF]Proxy by editing the NFProxy.ini file! look at the NFProxy.ini file description
 in this document!
-you can now set a locfile directory (only in the NFProxy.ini) all locs are loaded/saved from this dir if 
 one is set!
-5 Tracking Modes are now available! look at .track .trackfree .trackplus .trackminus
-the Proxy now calls NFProxy_spectator.cfg and NFProxy_player.cfg if you change into spectator mode or back!
 i have included my configurations so copy them into your id1 directory and edit them!
-i've added an ambient sound filter - only soundeffects will be played when enabled! 
 look at .staticsound!
-added 2 list commands, .proxyinfo : list all players with proxies and their versions,
                        .colors    : list all players with colors and user_id (for qw user command)
-new help command for the EasyFont feature : .helpfont
-new messagecommands:
 %P reports the powerup the Player has in short form : Q=Quad P=Pent R=Ring and F=Flag !!!
 %V will just report enemy names when pointed!
 %D name of enemy who killed you last
 %K name of enemy you killed last
-added an alias that will be called after mapend f_mapend. have a look at the alias section.
 you can use it for name animation scripts for example!

Version 0.66:
-------------
news:
-this documentation is now available in HTML format, look at NFProxy_Docu.htm !!!

changed features:
-good news for those of you who wrote me because of the lost seconds of the clock,
 i've found them and included them again but they are only available if you don't use the -t switch !!!
-removed the' Timers on' info after the Proxy Ident when not using the -t switch because if people read 
 'Timers on' in your userinfo when timers are blocked on the server by fpd they could think you are 
 cheating so when timers are enabled there will no timer statement printed after the Proxy Ident!
-changed the easyfont commands so you can use '#' and '$' again for soundtriggering!

new features:
-with .alwaysautoreport you can force the proxy to call the autoreport aliases even when every
 teammember is using [NF]Proxy!

Version 0.65:
-------------
news:
-NoX of the clan 'Das Kartell' is working on a GERMAN Documentation for [NF]Proxy !!!
-i have added a troubleshooting doc called Troubles.txt - please check it out!

removed bugs:
-the disconnect from proxy when trying to connect a running kombat team game with the wrong team set 
 is removed 
-i've rewritten the user info handling - this should remove the last skin probs
-removed a bug from the death log! gibstats now has no problems analysing it!

changed features:
-the fastrespawn feature is now automatically disabled in clanarena/arena and teamfortress mods!
-i have removed the saveloc command, nobody understands it's meaning - everyone thinks it's to save the normal loc files
 maybe nobody reads this documentation, who knows ...
-the proxy will now try to execute a NFProxy_qw.cfg when the gamedir is set to qw and it will try to execute 
 a NFProxy_mapname.cfg on mapchange! 
 This was requested by a few people, so i added it!
-WARNING: the intelligent reporting feature has changed!! its not compatible to other versions of [NF]Proxy!!
          be sure all of your team are working with the newest version!
-the clock has lost its seconds, don't know where they are gone!
-advanced the fpd settings ...

new features:
-POINTING added - have a look at %x %y %t and .reportlevel!!!
-I've added a feature that i call Location Pointing have a look at the messagecommand %f
-%v will report the name of the player you are looking at even if the player is an enemy!
-there is a new commandline parameter called -t 
 if set the proxy blocks all powerup counters and to the userinfo of NFProxy 'No Timers' is added!
 if not set the proxy add the status of your powerup counters to the userinfo of NFProxy!
-the well known nice feature funnames of cheapo is now available for [NF]Proxy
 (he copied my Easy Gamespy Starter and my advanced Sountrigger Options so this is fair!)
 have a look at the Easyfont section!
-colorforcing is now available, have a look at .teamcolor and .enemycolor!
-added a .colorsetskin feature. when enabled the team/enemyskins are set using your bottomcolor and not your team.
 this is very usefull when playing teamfortress (so the spy problem is gone, thanx to Kerstin of HF for the tip)
 and maybe when playing clanarena!
-now support for Team Fortress! - keys/flag will be reported, the fastrespawn features automatically disabled and
 the colorsetskin mode is forced for skin forcing features! 
 for key reporting have a look at .reportlevel !!!
 i don't know if the fraglog is working absolute correctly under team fortress, if you observe an error please
 report it to me because i don't play team fortress ... 
-class pointing added for TeamFortress if you point at a teammember or enemy his class will also be reported!
-i have added a command that let you filter the serverinfo w_switch and b_switch. if you get the message
 infostring length exceeds sometimes or if you get kicked by TeamFortress for skin change (without changing the skin)
 try this one! if you are using my bestweapon feature you don't need them and i don't think that TeamFortress uses them!
 so have a look at .filterswitches!
-you can change the names of the Flag and the Keys using .sfn .sskn and .sgkn!
-Runes can now be reported have a look at the .reportlevel (for the Orange mod for example!)
-added a help page for all the message commands, try .helpmessages (or .hm)
-the status screen is now available for the linux version

           if you don't like the status screen disable it using commandlineparameter -q
-new commandline parameter -eTIME lets the Proxy terminate itself after TIME minutes of inaktivity!

Version 0.55:
-------------
news:
-[NF]Proxy is now available for Linux (i386)!

removed bugs:
-the listfrag is now working correctly again!
-the reconnect feature now reconnects correctly even when you are already conencted (i was too lazy to fix it before!)
-the 100 Health name is now used by the tooktrigger too!
-fixed a problem with GameSpy V2.04/2.05 - i'm not a registred Gamespy User so i could'n remove this before!!!
 thanx to Phadda for reporting it!
-removed a bug in the .deadbodyfilter ...
-removed a bug in the skin handling, thanx to the guys from Das Kartell for reporting and testing it!

new features:
-you can now log the death messages to a file using .logdeath and the chat messages using .logchat
 this is for those people who want to use gibstats together with the messages filters [NF]Proxy have or the
 owndeathmessages of [NF]Proxy! - or if you just want shorter log files instead of this large condebug files!

changed features:
-yeah - the good old bloodstyle explosion is now available again! use .setexplosion 8 to enable it!
-.easyrecord will now add the current date & time to the file name in the case that no quakedir is given or the 
 qwcl client is not running on the same computer!
 and it now first executes a stop demo command!
-WARNING : i have changed the fpd value for disable of the intelligentreporting from 256 to 1024 because the qizmo guys 
 added fpd values for skin force disable and color force disable and used my intelligentreporting fpd value!
 i can't understand why they do something like that because its very easy to use the qw commands
 noskins 2/baseskin to get the same result for enemys-/team- skins!

Version 0.54:
-------------
removed bugs:
-the messagecommands %e %E %o %O now check correctly if team mates or enemies in your vicinity are dead
 or not!

new features:
-for all of you who are using blood for explosions, you can now change the number of bloodparticles which
 will be spawned! have a look at .setbloodlevel!
-messagecomamnd %i now reports the last taken object including armors, weapons, packs, ammo and health!
 %I reports the last taken item that has triggered the f_took alias!
-advanced the tooktrigger so have a look at it!

 this feature is just for people who know what they are doing!
-you can change the name of 100Health using .set100hname and the name of Backpacks using .setbackpackname!

Version 0.53:
-------------
removed bugs:
-ok, i did it! i removed a bug in the listfrags routine (v0.52) and failed! the new listfrag routine crashs
 the whole proxy when called! when .autolistfrags is enabled this routine is called after every map!
 removed this bug!
-i've changed the integrated gamespy starter,now it checks frequently the status of the (gl)qwcl client.
 this way the proxy terminates itself (if it's started with -x) when qwcl is quit!
 in older versions the proxy terminated when the qwcl client disconnected!

new features:
-because it's hard to use one config file for all the mod's out there i give you the possibility to write
 a config file for everyone, where you just have to set the differences from your normal config!
 have a look at the 'How to create configuration Files for [NF]Proxy' section!

Version 0.52:
-------------
removed bugs:
-there was this nasty bug, which let the server tell anyone that you are playing with none standard eyes/player modells,
 that happend when connecting to a server as spectator and than try to reconnect or connect the same or another server!
-removed a bug in the network send routine which caused a proxy crash with the error WSAEWouldBlock!
 thanx to exo-ice for reporting this bug!
-some people seems to have more fingers than other :-), so i increased the numbers of bestweapon slots from 3 to 5!
-removed a bug in .lal thanx to Neophyte for reporting this bug!
-in version 0.51 i have increased the max number of marks per loc file, but i forgot to use a bigger counter for it!
 the old one overflows after 256 marks!
-removed a bug in the fraglog. i used a integer for the effi compare so the value after the dot wasn't handled correctly!

new features:
-now you can let the proxy drop client packets (.dropclientpackets) this will give you smoother gameplay and less network
 traffic. you can control it by using the new feature .showpackets, which shows you the client packets received per second,
 the server packets received per seconds and the number of dropped packets by he proxy, so you can tune your qwcl as you wish!
-support for f_lagreport when typed in the console the proxy tells all how many fake lag you are using!
-i added a alternative network routine which can be enabled by using the new startupparameter -n.
 if you have lag problems - test it and tell me about your experiences on it!!!
-i worked a little bit on the spectator mode. if speccing a game and intellireporting is enabled the proxy tells you
 who in which team has an powerup!

Version 0.51:
-------------
problems:
some of the new functions like .odm or .dmf can cause lag! i don't know if this problem exists even in
this release so please test it and tell me about your experiences!!!
and please send me bug reports, this will help me to make this Proxy a hell of a tool!!!

removed bugs:
-ok i hear you all screaming about the bestweapon funktion. i recommend you to use it, because it's
 very powerfull!!!
 i have added a possibility to turn it completely off (default!), just use .bestweapon off
 and i have removed a bug in it!
-do you remember the user defineable timers for servers with disabled powerup timers???
 now you can only use them when powerup timers are enabled (don't know if they are usefull anymore :-)) ...!
 use the new clock instead!
-not a bug: the 'N' symbol for no armor in %A reporting is gone!
-splitted help into two help commands: .help and .helpadvanced, because the help command got to
 big for some data packages so the client disconencted!
-removed some debug code, this should speed up things a little bit!
-a friend send me a loc file with 390 marks in it, so i changed it again to 400 marks per loc, 
 if this is not enought - go to hell :-))
 
new features:
-you can now change the name of the Armors, look at .setraname .setyaname and .setganame
-a name can now be disabled by using the off parameter! (.sqn .srn .spn .snn .sran .syan .sgan)
-a clock is now available, look at .clock

Version 0.5:
------------
removed bugs:
-there was a bug, that appeared by some people : when the countdown of the kombat teams mod reached the end
 there came lots of u_remove on full update before the game starts ... that should be fixed now!
-the %o %O failure is gone, it added you to teammembers in your vicinity even when you were dead!
-not really a bug - the beeping of commands is no removed!
-the skin bug (hopefully) should now be history.
-not a bug but no new feature, you now can use up to 200 marks per loc file for a map
 unbelieveable that a uk clan mailed me because 128 marks are not enought for their loc
 files, don't know what maps they are playing :-)
-rewritten the network code

new features:
-fastrespawn feature will respawn you as fast as possible (or timed) using a jump (look at .fastrespawn)
-blend filter for item pickup blending (.blendfilter)
-added a need messagecommand that checks automatically what you need (armor/health/weapons/ammo) and reports it (%z)
 you can control it by using (.setneed)!
-i added a damage filter so the red flash when getting hit can now be filtered (.damagefilter)
-user defineable timers for servers with disabled powerup timers, you can set up to 10 timers (.inittimer .cleartimer)
-took trigger for taken armors (.tooktrigger and %i)
-deathtrigger and respawntrigger. if you die/respawn the proxy automatically calls aliases
 called f_death and f_respawn, ok thats too much for 4on4 but its ideal for 2on2 or maybe 3on3!
-you can now change the name of the Powerups, look at .setquadname .setpentname .setringname and .setnonename
-added message commands which let you easily use up to 4 lines of text in one chat message! (%u and %U)
-powerup takes of teammates and enemies are  now reported using the aliases f_team and f_enemy, so you can now
 create your own autoreporting messages by writing own f_team and f_enemy aliases!
-added easyrecord function, you never have to type in names for demos again! have a look at .easyrecord
-soundtrigger is now available have a look at .soundtrigger, it's different from all soundtrigger features of other
 proxies! - so be sure to check it out!
-i've changed/added some message commands, have a look at them because the meaning of %b and %d have been changed!
 the reason is easy, its for compatibility with other proxies ... i dont want you to change your communication scripts,
 just because you change proxies ...
 %b now reports your best weapon depending on the weapon priority set with (.setweaponpriority)
 %r reports the number of rockets you have(just what %b did before!)
 %c reports the number of cells you have
 %L reports your last dying position with a time limit of 5 sec.
    after time is up it reports your current position like %l  (thats what %d did before!)
 %d now reports your last dying position without any time limit!
 %w reports your current weapon!
 %W reports the ammo of your current weapon!
 %G reports upcommin Powerups with their location
 %S is a new intelligent communication feature, it works like %s but it will show you the armor/health/bestweapon from all
    teammembers in your vicinity! (it's very usefull in dmm1 and if amors/powerups appear to look who should get it!)
-best weapon feature (.bestweapon) : you can define up to 3 impulses for best weapon selections
-added a death message filter, you can filter all death message or the ones from
 the other players (.dmf)
-own death messages added, if enabled, short deathmessages from teammembers will be
 displayed (.odm)! use it together with the deathmessage filter function!
-hostname resolution is now available! so you can use hostnames instead of ip addresses
 to connect a server!
-added stopconnecting feature (.sc)

 if time is up it reports your current location ...
-autoreport is much intelligenter now! it only reports when there is a teammember who is not
 using [NF]Proxy, or if intelligent reporting is disabled (by server or by you)!
-added a .cdtracks feature, for those of you who have problems with cd track changes 
 on map changes! - just for you dust :-)
-added the .echo command - if disabled no standard message will be printed when setting 
 a parameter, just command parsing errors and all list commands will be printed to console
-now you set the style of the exposions by using .setexplosion, there are up to 8 different 
 explosion styles to choose from.
-added a floodprotection feature, which protects you from getting the 10 sec. flooding penalty
 time from the qw server when sending more than 4 messages in 4 seconds (.floodprotect)!

 .loadloc .saveloc)

-[NF]Proxy detects the KombatTeams mod and resets the fraglog after the countdown has
 ended and it ignores the powerups the players have before starting the countdown!

Version 0.31
------------
removed bugs:
-don't know how it could happen, i've released a not running version of [NF]Proxy (V0.3).
 the night before i was on the dcc session in essen/germany and i havent slept that night :-)
 so this is a correct running version of [NF]Proxy.
 this version is compatible to QW2.21 QW2.29 and QW2.30.

Version 0.3
-----------
new features
-support of proxyautoexec aliases (required for bod-tct's proxy starter for gamespy)
-support for combat teams/ocr teammod statistics, they are using standard qw death 
 messages but send them as one string - not like qw which sends death messages in pieces,
 so i have to parse the whole death string now!
-dead body filter - filters all parts of dead bodies! (increase fps)
-muzzle flash can be turned off.
-support for QW Version 2.30
-quiet mode - needed by some GLQWCL users. when connecting [NF]Proxyt prints text on
 the screen, some 3dfx drivers switches the display to normal mode, so you just will get
 a blank screen or something like it. this feature will help to avoid this problem!

Version 0.2 (first public beta!)
--------------------------------
features:
-intelligent poweruptimers: the timer of all players using [NF]Proxy
 communicate to synchronize themself. So you won't miss an powerup take.
