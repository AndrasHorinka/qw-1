Troubleshooting:
----------------

Easy GameSpy Starter:

-be sure to use the ':' after your command line even when you don't pass parameters to (gl)qwcl
 for example : NFProxy.exe -gqwcl.exe -bf:\quake -x -q : 

-check that the gamespy.cfg and frontend.cfg in the quake/id1 dir are not writeprotected!

-don't use a batch file (expecially when using the -x commandline parameter!),
 you can write all parameters after the ':' or put them in the autoexec.cfg in your quake/id1 dir

-be sure to add .exe after the qw client name so the exefile will be started and not a batch file with the same name!
 for example : qwcl.exe or glqwcl.exe

GL Users:

-if you get a black screen on connecting [NF]Proxy from glqwcl.exe be sure to use the -q
 commandline parameter!

Linux Users:

-if you start [NF]Proxy using a telnet client and get a segmentation fault use the 
 commandline parameter -q (i get this prob when i'm using the standart telnet from windows...)
 i don't know why this happens, i'm using the standart curses lib! if anyone knows tell me please ...

Powerup Timers/Clock:

-if you can't see the poweruptimers or the clock try to position them using .sptl 14 0 32
 this will set them to a 320*200 resolution position!

-if you can't see them using .sptl 14 0 32 check the scr_centertime setting, if it's set to 0 you
 can't see any centerprinted messages so set it to a value greater than 0, i prefer 3!

TeamFortress:

-if you get kicked for changing your skin when changing the class it's because the user infostring gets too long.
 this happens when all userinfo variables of the client together exceeds 64 bytes!
 this could happen for example if you set the TeamFortress serverinfo variables EXEC_CLASS and CLASSHELP !!!
 to avoid this you can let [NF]Proxy filter the w_switch and the b_switch variable, use the command .filterswitches on
 i don't think they will be used in TeamFortress!

Misc:

-if you get the message "Outgoing message overflow" your config files are too big!
 you can avoid this by placing the command wait in the config files!
 if qw finds an wait command it sends the message packet and creates a new one with the following commands
 so no overflow will hapen ...

-if you are jumping around disable the .fastrespawn feature, some mods put you in status dead even when
 you are not dead like teamfortress when reloading a weapon, or rocket arena!
