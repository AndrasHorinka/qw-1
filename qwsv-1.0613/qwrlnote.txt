Changes to QuakeWorld Client
----------------------------
New:
- Added download percentage bar.  Displays filename and a bar indicating        
  visual completeness of download and a percentage.  Overwrites
  any text at the bottom.
- Added auto-tracking camera for spectator mode.  It's mostly a novelty, but
  its fun.
- Added +showteamscores.  In team games, the intermission displays team
  totals, unless you hit TAB to display frag scores
  bind a key to +showteamscores will give you the team score display.
- Added client side DEMO support and playback
  usage:  record <file> <server>
  Autodownload is disabled when recording.
  playback: playdemo <file>
  File uses the .qwd extension and is incompatible with regular Quake and its 
  demos.
- Adjust console input a bit to allow room for download percent bar (moved up
  six pixels).
- Add cl_hightrack cvar for spectator mode, causes it to always
  select camera view on player with the highest frags.  cl_hightrack 1 turns
  it on, cl_hightrack 0 turns it off (default)
- Added text to the "Single player" and "Multiplayer" menu options.
- Allowed Ctrl-V (paste) at console.
- Added GL support.
- Added FOV setting in GL version.

Fixed/Changed:
- If a model file isn't found (couldn't be download) a msg is displayed
  telling the user they may need to download or purchase an addon pak.
- Made all skin downloads go into QW directory.
- Fixed water jump bug where you hop immediately back out in narrow entrances.
- Added copyright dialog on exit (press y to quit) with credits and version
  number.
- New cvar, cl_warncmd, defaults to zero and disables the 'unknown command'
  msg.  qwcl stuffs 'cl_warncmd 1' to itself after quake.rc loads. This gets
  rid of unknown command messages (like unknown command 'startdemos') from 
  the default exec files, as well as hiding "execing" messages.
- New command, windows, which will pop a user in fullscreen mode back to     
  Windows (not GL or Linux versions).
- Turned off bobbing in spectator mode.
- Now execs the config.cfg in a gamedir upon receiving a new gamedir from
  the server (saves the current config into the current gamedir before
  switching to the new one).
- Reconnect command will now reconnect to the server it is currently   
  connected to, or last one it was connected to.
- Fixed it so entering 'record <file> <server>' while connected disconnects 
  before starting recording.
- Fixed scoreboard while dead in GL version.
- Made it so players are never completely black in the GL version.
- Changed some console load up msgs in GL.
- Fixed it so exec files without a trailing new line still work.
- changed effects in gl to not be as striking (hard to see).
- Fixed it so a 'glquake' directory is created in other gamedirs for model
  meshes in GL version.
- Fixed tolerance on corrupt skin files.

Changes to QuakeWorld Server
----------------------------
New:
- Added new allow_download vars:
	allow_download_skins, allow_download_models,
	allow_download_sounds, allow_download_maps
- Added a few client to server commands for auto-camera support.
- Adding new server cvar, sv_spectalk (defaults to 1, or on) that controls
  whether spectators can talk to players.  If disabled, spectators can
  only talk to each other.
- New command, sv_gamedir, which sets the visible gamedir to clients.  this
  allows servers to have a different physical game directories, handing for
  machines with multiple servers that don't support symbolic links.  for
  example:
  		gamedir ctf4.1
		sv_gamedir ctf
  causes qwsv to use the physical directory of 'ctf4.1', but report the
  directory to clients (players) as 'ctf' for their files.

Fixed/Changed:
- Fixed bug in serverinfo strings (memory overwrite and length problem).
- Map files are permitted to be downloaded if they aren't in a pak file
  (unless allow_download or allow_download_maps isn't set).
- Fixed annoying NET_GetPacket: Connection Refused msgs.
- Fixed annoying water jump bug where you would immedately hop back out of 
  water just after you jumped in.
- Fixed air velocity movement so that it is like regular Quake, 
  players have more control over their air movement and can cut
  velocity as needed just like in Quake.  This gives more control
  to the player and rewards skill.
- Spectators no longer can send or receive say_team msgs (possible
  cheating could happen).
- Stopped reporting spectators as players when front-ends request info.
- Fixed bug that disallowed 9's in ip address for filtering.
- Spectators can now send say_team msgs, but only to other spectators.
- No duplicate names allowed now (will rename people who do it).
- A client can not name themselves 'console'.


Known Issues: 
-------------
GLQWCL:

-Alt-Tabbing does not work correctly for many people.  You will get 
 Windows mode, but your GL video will freeze when you return.  
 This is a result of a bug in the current GLIDE (v2.3x) drivers.  
 3dfx is working on a fix. Check http://www.3dfx.com for an update.

QWCL:

-We are not supporting TeamFortress.  If you run into problems with TF, 
please email only the TF people, not us and *especially* not the QSpy people.

-Auto-tracking does not work when connected to v1.55 servers.

WorkArounds:
------------

-If you get the message 'GLIDE.DLL not found' OR QSpy reports error 1157, 
you need to get and install the latest Glide drivers from 
http://www.3dfx.com (currently v2.31).
