<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is Cheapo and what can
it do?</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>Cheapo is a proxy that can be used to route QuakeWorld network traffic.
Additionally, the proxy can modify the data and has features for enhancing
gameplay. You can connect to cheapo as if it were a Quakeworld server,
and then give it commands that forward you to a real server. You can also
go through multiple proxies, if you like. The most common way to use a
proxy is to run it on the local computer, just to get access to the gameplay
features. The proxy can also be run on a firewall machine incapable of
handling Quake traffic, so that machines inside the firewall can be used
for playing. See the <A HREF="#features">features list</A> for the gameplay
enhancements.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Some Background</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>I personally needed a QuakeWorld proxy to get through a firewall, and
decided to build one when I heard that the new QuakeWorld will be incompatible
(and thus the excellent FAQ-proxy would stop working). Now that the proxy
has stabilized a bit and many people have asked me to publish it, I have
decided to do so. However, please remember that this started out as a personal
experiment, and is still pretty much that. So I add features and fix bugs
that I personally feel are most important. In any case I do plan on keeping
this proxy up to date at least in the near future. Also note, that this
proxy has been mostly tested in DeathMatch play, so problems with TF, CTF
or other addons are more possible.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>How much does it cost</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>It doesn't cost anything. Howerver, nothing is really free. Since there
is no real support, and the documentation is very limited, it means you
have to work harder to get things working smoothly. And you might encounter
unexpected problems. Or your computer could be blown to bits (just kidding,
but hey, everything is possible). If you want the security of a well tested
product, try the other link on the <A HREF="index.htm">main page</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>How to use it</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>I can really only recommend Cheapo if you have previous experience
with QuakeWorld proxies. In that case installing and using it should be
a breeze. Still, here are some quick instructions:
<UL>
<LI>
download the file (see end of page) and unzip it somewhere</LI>

<LI>
execute <TT>cheapo</TT></LI>

<LI>
start up quakeworld</LI>

<LI>
type in the console: "<TT>connect localhost</TT>", the proxy should now
respond</LI>

<LI>
connect to another server by typing: "<TT>.connect name.of.server</TT>"&nbsp;
(note the dot before connect)</LI>

<LI>
to disconnect from the server, but not the proxy, type: "<TT>.disconnect</TT>"</LI>

<LI>
to disconnect from the proxy, just type the normal: "<TT>disconnect</TT>"</LI>
</UL>
By typing "<TT>.help"</TT> in the console you get the list of all supported
command. More help for a particular command is available with "<TT>.help
command"</TT> . All the documentation (which isn't much) is available through
this help command. Communication with the proxy is done by talking to it,
so if you make cfg-files, remember to use '<TT>say .command</TT>' and not
just '<TT>.command</TT>'. Also note that you can define an alias named
<TT>proxyautoexec</TT> in your own config. This is executed by the proxy
whenever you connect to it.

<P>All proxy commands are prefixed with <TT>.</TT> (dot) to distinquish
them from everything else. Normally the proxy also recognizes commands
prefixed with <TT>proxy:</TT> or <TT>hostname:</TT> so to connect you could
type: "<TT>.connect"</TT> or <TT>"proxy:connect"</TT> or <TT>"xyz:connect"</TT>
(if the computer's hostname is xyz). If you are going to a server through
multiple proxies, the prefixes start to matter. Commands with the dot-prefix
always go to the nearest proxy (so use .command for setting up powerup
times and the like), and commands with the proxy:-prefix go to the last
proxy (so use proxy:connect for connecting). Using the hostname-prefix
of course affects the proxy with that hostname.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="features"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Features</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>The easiest way to give a summary of features is to just list the command
the proxy supports. Although this list might get outdated (or is already),
it's still pretty close. It is possible that some commands change in the
future. You have been warned.

<BR>To show how all these %-commands can be put to use, I have made a list
of the teamplay aliases I am currently using. You can probably come up
with even more ways to use these, but this list is a good starting point
if you want some ideas. My goal has been to minimize the number of messages,
but there are still quite a few. The left side shows the actual command
bound to a key, and the right side shows an example of what it looks like
in game.

<P><B><I>First the classic binds:</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">[a:0] h:100 rl:5</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
This is used to report your current health/armor/weapon status. It's used
most often when there are many peoply near an armor and you have to decide
who takes it (the one with lowest armor). This is only shown to visible
teammates. Cheapo adds glowing braces [ ] around those parts of the message
that are low to make them more easily visible. Armor and health is 'low'
if it's under 50, weapon is 'low' if it's worse than a RL with 3 rockets,
or a LG with 10 cells.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">red armor secured (1-0)</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
To tell your teammates that you have an area under control. Of course it's
preplanned what areas are being controlled and so on. The 1-0 means 1 teammate
(you) and 0 enemies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team %L lost (%E enemies)</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">red armor lost (2 enemies)</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
To tell your teammates that control of an important area is lost. The uppercase
%L and %E make this work even if I press it a few seconds after dying at
the new spawn location.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team help to %L!</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">help to red armor!</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
To ask for help when the situation is quickly getting worse. It's better
to ask for help early than to be a hero and lose control to the enemy.
It's also important that teammates come for help (that's what the next
message is used for)!
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team coming from %l</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">coming from grenade</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
A reply when someone asks for help or is offering an item (the binds below)
and you need it. The location is important so that the other person knows
how far away you are.

<P><B><I>Then some new binds that combine many of the older ones:</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team "%t"</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">pack at grenade</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The %t belongs to the pointing commands, and is very powerful. It can be
used to report the precence of almost any item or player. All you have
to do is point to the item and press this bind. The items considered for
pointing can be adjusted with the .point command (default is powerups,
armors, players, packs, rune/flag, megahealth, rl, gl, lg). Most often
used to report that a pack with a rl (in DMM1 games) or that an armor is
available. Of course you would only report when you don't need that item
desperately yourself. Anyone who is near and wants the item should reply
with 'coming from', in which case the other player guards the item. If
nobody is coming in a few seconds, it's best to just take the item so the
enemy doesn't get it. You can also use point to tell where you see an enemy
(the proxy tells if the enemy has quad or penta too).
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team taken: %k</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">taken: pack at grenade</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
This is another multipurpose bind that can be used to report that you took
an item, or that an item you said was available (by pointing) no longer
is. The logic for %k is that it displays the name/location of the last
item you either pointed to or collected yourself. If you want to separate
the two cases, there are commands %i and %j for that.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">f_powerup</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">i have quad pent</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Used to report that you got a powerup. It will list all the powerups you
have.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team get %g (at %l)</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">get quad (at lower rl)</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
If your responsibility is to collect a certain powerup, and you are unable
to do so, this is used to tell that someone else has to do it. The proxy
will list all powerups appearing within 10 secs (if timers are enabled).
If the proxy has no knowledge of powerup times, it will say quad (since
this is the most common case).
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%"><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">say_team enemy %q!</FONT></TT></B></TD>

<TD><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">enemy pent!</FONT></TT></B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Used to notify teammates of a powerupped enemy you saw. The proxy adds
the powerups of the last seen enemy. In case the proxy has seen no enemies
it will say quad (since again it's the most common case).

<P><B><I>Additional notes:</I></B>
<BR>If you don't like the new f_report style, you can redefine f_report
with '<TT>alias f_report say_team '%Aa:%a h:%h %b %p %n</TT>' which was
the one used by FAQ-proxy. Just not that the definition has to be done
<I>after</I> you connect to the proxy. You can also redefine f_powerup,
and f_took.

<P>The f_report and f_powerup binds can be automatically triggered by the
proxy (when someone says a report or you get a powerup). This is enabled
with command '<TT>.report power reply'</TT>.

<P>If you want to set a lot of settings when connecting to the proxy, a
handy way to do it is to make a proxy.cfg, and then define in your main
config '<TT>alias proxyautoexec exec proxy.cfg</TT>'. The proxyautoexec
alias is executed whenever you connect to Cheapo.
