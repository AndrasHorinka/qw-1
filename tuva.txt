FAQ
---

Q: Who is Tuva?
A: She is a spoofing utility for QuakeWorld.

Q: Tuva does not work in Windows 9x, why?
A: She uses raw sockets and that is only available in Windows 2000 and Windows XP by default.

Q: Ok, How do I run her?
A: You have three options

    1) Make Tuva spoof packets her self:
    
	         A              B                   C
	     -------- -------------------- --------------------
	tuva -l 27500 -s 192.168.1.1:27001 -d 192.168.1.2:27500

	A) This is the port she will listen on (where you connect your qw client)
	B) This is the IP and port you will spoof
	C) This is the server you want to connect to (qw server, qizmo, etc)

    2) Make Tuva spoof packets through a gateway:
	
	         A              B                   C                   D
	     -------- -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
	tuva -l 27500 -s 192.168.1.1:27001 -d 192.168.1.2:27500 -g 192.168.1.3:27500

	A) This is the port she will listen on (where you connect your qw client)
	B) This is the IP and port you will spoof
	C) This is the server you want to connect to (qw server, qizmo, etc)
	D) This is the IP and port to the Tuva gateway, this host will send the spoofed packets for you.

    3) Make Tuva act as the spoofing gateway:

	        A
	     --------
	tuva -a 27500

	A) This is what port number she will be listening on (-g 192.168.1.3:27500)


Q: I get multiple "Unknown command "-tuva-"", why?
A: There can be many reasons for this, but the problem is that the proxy can not send the spoofed packet to the server.

Q: How do I know if I can send spoofed packets?
A: This question is out of the scope for this document. 

Q: Why did you code Tuva?
A: ParadokS banned me from the swedish servers at Bredbandbolaget. I dont think I deserved to be banned so I had to find a solution to my problem, and here she is.

Q: Where do I report bugs?
A: There are no bugs in Tuva, she is perfect.

Q: Where do I send fan mails?
A: paradoks@slackers.dk
